Tested using MARS MIPS simulator - to run, execute mipshack_main and make sure your simulator can see map3.txt. To change the map or path to map file, edit the map_filename label in mipshack_main.asm. Make sure that your map text files have UNIX-style line endings (the provided map files have CRLF instead of LF... but I'm too lazy to change atm).
